time_cost_calib

[After the intro, data, and model sections are done] 
For the purposes of the presentation, would it be possible to do a calibration/counterfactual where you have a time-cost role 
for mental health, but set this so that you are matching the overall hours differences (including zeros) in the data by mental health. 
You would not need to show all of the fit pictures again and re-explain the calibration. 
Just something to show people that you might get big effects. Is this clear / feasible?
 
 
Do you mean to set the time cost parameter so that I match the difference in hours Unconditional on employment? 
I think this is feasible. I would just need to think about my sample a bit. 
Currently I drop everyone who says they are employed but works less than 10 hours. 
Maybe I want to include those people when I calculate the difference in hours by mental health status unconditional on employment 
in the data.
