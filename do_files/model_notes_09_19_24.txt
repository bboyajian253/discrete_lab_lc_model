Notes from my latest 3 advising meetings:

*** Adam 09/17/24*** What is the most importatnt difference for the model vs the data?  - moments by health

    Trim wages if work <10 hours instead of 5

    Make simpler not by age moments first then make the lifecycle equivalent
    
    Persistance of labor earnings inequality
    - picture shows auto correlation of earnings at various lags (Adam has one in a paper)
    - how does the model compare to the data?

    Mean earnings by health types/states
    -states first? model and data.

    Share of people in bad health state by age in the data and model
    By earnings level (decile, quintile, etc) what is the percentage in bad health state.
    - how does the model compare to the data?
    
    Analyze the counterfactuals: What did I show? What did I learn?
    -Relable the counterfactuals
    -Compare to the literature: here is what they did, here is how I am different/the same, here is why I am different/the same
    -different question, different model, different data, different method, different results?
    - why is the effect of the time cost earlier in life vs later in life different?
    - why does the variance in labor earinings decerase in the model?
    -Given that health effects people mechanically in the same way throughout the model why does inequality
        in labor earnings decrease over the lifecycle in the model?

*** Kathleen 09/12/24 ***
    Identification of the health types
    If MH is less transitory then PH then the model should reflect that so why persistant/permanent types?
    Estimate the wages separately from the model. Estimate a wage profile and estimate the shocks from the residuals between
        the estimated wage process/profile and the data. Ala Eric French (2005) and others.
    Fixed cost of labor participation by age to match early life participation rates
    In general try and follow the literature more closely when estimating things i.e. Eric French (2005)
    Survival probabilities
    Bequest motives? 
    Simulate the variance(idk what this means).
    Does MH impact survival probabilities?
